<p>The purpose of the project is to facilitate the creation of shortcuts to standardize and facilitate the use of git in everyday life</p>
<p>For that, I used the repository below as a basis for creating the shortcuts:</p>

[iuricode commit pattern](https://github.com/iuricode/commit-patterns)

<p>Which is based on the documentation of:</p>

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

# 🔨 Installation

### Linux - Ubuntu

- Navigate to a local directory of your choice to download the .sh with the script, for example:

```
cd ~
```

- Run the command below to download the script:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m4rcos-dev/Git-alias/main/git-alias.sh
```

- Give permissions to the .sh file to run the script:

```
chmod +x git-alias.sh
```

- Run the script:

```
./git-alias.sh
```

After these steps the shortcuts will be configured to verify use the command:

```
git myalias
```

If all goes well, you will have an output similar to this:

```caddpack=!f() { git commit -m " :heavy_plus_sign: build: $1"; }; f
cbug=!f() { git commit -m " :bug: fix: $1"; }; f
cbuildconfig=!f() { git commit -m " :package: build: $1"; }; f
cconfig=!f() { git commit -m ":wrench: chore: $1"; }; f
cdoc=!f() { git commit -m " :books: docs: $1"; }; f
cfeat=!f() { git commit -m ":sparkles: feat: $1"; }; f
cfix=!f() { git commit -m " :boom: fix: $1"; }; f
cinfra=!f() { git commit -m " :bricks: ci: $1"; }; f
cinit=!f() { git commit -m ":tada: init: $1"; }; f
cpack=!f() { git commit -m " :package: build: $1"; }; f
cperf=!f() { git commit -m " :zap: perf: $1"; }; f
crefactor=!f() { git commit -m " :recycle: refactor: $1"; }; f
cremovepack=!f() { git commit -m " :heavy_minus_sign: build: $1"; }; f
cstyle=!f() { git commit -m ":lipstick: style: $1"; }; f
ctestfinal=!f() { git commit -m ":heavy_check_mark: test: $1"; }; f
ctestfinish=!f() { git commit -m " :whit_check_mark: test: $1"; }; f
cteststart=!f() { git commit -m " :test__tube: test: $1"; }; f
myalias=! git config -l | grep ^alias\. | cut -c 7- | sort
pushbranch=push -u origin
```

# ✨ Usage

The semantic commit has the structural elements below (types), which inform the intent of your commit to the user of your code.

- `feat`- Commits of type feat indicate that your piece of code is including a new feature (it relates to the MINOR of semantic versioning).

- `fix` - Commits of type fix indicate that your committed code snippet is solving a problem (bug fix), (related to the semantic versioning PATCH).

- `docs` - Commits of type docs indicate that there have been changes in the documentation, for example in the Readme of your repository. (Does not include code changes).

- `test` - Commits of type test are used when changes are made to tests, either by creating, modifying or deleting unit tests. (Does not include code changes)

- `build` - Build-type commits are used when making changes to build files and dependencies.

- `perf` - Commits of type perf serve to identify any code changes that are related to performance.

- `style` - Commits of type style indicate that there were changes regarding code formatting, semicolons, trailing spaces, lint... (Does not include code changes).

- `refactor` - Commits of the type refactor refer to changes due to refactorings that do not change its functionality, for example, a change in the format of how a certain part of the screen is processed, but which maintained the same functionality, or performance improvements due to a code review.

- `chore` - Chore commits indicate updates to build tasks, admin settings, packages... like adding a package to gitignore. (Does not include code changes)

- `ci` - Commits of type ci indicate continuous integration related changes.

### By default, shortcuts for commits always start with the letter c for commit followed by the name of the shortcut for the commit and the message defined between "" at commit time.

example

```
git cfeat "add new component"
```

this is a shortcut for the command

```
git commit -m ":sparkles: feat: add new component"
```

### Use the table below to consult the shortcuts and type of commit that will be made.
